# filechat

> "The hottest new programming language is English" - Andrej Karpathy

no more memorizing unix command cheatsheets... filechat is all you need  
filechat lets you talk to your computing with plain english üó£Ô∏è  

e.g. telling the computer in english `update permissions so that owners can have read/write access to photos` is a lot easier to remember than `find / -name "*.jpg" -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;`

     ```

   - Move the executable:
     ```bash
     mv filechat ~/bin/
     ```

2. **Add `~/bin` to Your PATH** (if not already included):
   - Open your terminal and add the following line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
     ```bash
     export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
     ```
   - Reload your shell configuration:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc  # Or replace .bashrc with your specific config file
